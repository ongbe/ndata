/**
 * This is for accessing a memory contiguous dynamic variable length array 
 * as you would if it were declared as a static multidimensional array on the
 * stack (which CANNOT be heap allocated)
 *
 * USAGE: 
 *
 * preparing the array:
 *
 *   struct NdShape rshp={size_t rank=n, {size_t i1_max, ..., in_max}Â };
 *   float *ndarr=malloc(sizeof(float)*nd_length(rshp));
 * 
 * accessing the array:
 *
 *   float ndarr_elem=ndarr[nd_i(rshp, i1, ..., in)];
 *
 * don't forget to free memory:
 *
 *   free(ndarr);
 *
 *
 * Memory contiguous array are allocated like a 1D array, not pointer to
 * pointer so you cannot access it with the form array[i][j][k].... Same
 * applies for nested std::vector<> in c++.  Instead you can access it with
 * array[ndarray(size_t rank, size_t rshp, ...size_t i,size_t j,size_t k)] by using
 * this function which is easier than handling the pointer arithmetic yourself.
 *
 * Boost multiarray would be an alternative for multidimensional dynamic
 * contiguous arrays with c++, although it is said to be slow.
